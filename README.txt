SRL Reflection Library v2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is SRL Reflection v2.2, designed to be modular and lightweight,
as well as independant from outside resources (includes). The goal
for this include is to use as little CPU and RAM as possible to allow
the maximum number of clients running simultaniously. 

This software is written to be used with Simba[1] and SMART[2], and 
requires the SRL Repository in order to function properly. More
information can be found at the Villavu forums[3].
